# Architecture Tokens

[![Check](https://github.com/architecture-tokens/website/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/architecture-tokens/website/actions/workflows/check.yml)

Architecture Tokens are the smallest reusable semantic units for software architecture.

They give diagrams, documentation, reviews, and automation a shared, machine-readable architectural vocabulary. A token describes architectural meaning independently from a particular cloud provider, product, or rendering tool.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository contains an early `v0.1` draft. The model will evolve as it is tested against real architecture work.

## v0.1 package

```yaml
kind: token-library
namespace: common
domains: [database]
version: 0.1.0
name: Common architecture tokens
tokens:
  - id: database
    kind: component-type
    name: Database
    description: A persistent structured data store.
```

The package defines token libraries, architecture models, typed policy sets, validation reports, and renderer-input normalized models. Common, core, security, environment, and lifecycle are separate namespaces; applied token uses are `{token, value?}` objects.

## Token-only model

v0.1 uses **Token** as its only reusable semantic vocabulary. A Token is not a
managed cloud resource or deployment. Instead, an architecture model contains
components and relationships, which reference Tokens for their type and
annotations:

- `core:component.service` types a component such as `orders-api`.
- `common:database` types a persistent store such as `orders-ledger`.
- `core:relationship.call.sync` types its call to `payments-api`.
- `lifecycle:lifecycle.deprecated` can annotate either element with a lifecycle
  fact.

An **Asset**—for example, a Kubernetes Deployment, database instance,
repository, alert policy, or cloud account—is deliberately outside v0.1. It may
eventually be mapped to a component through an integration or a mapping, but it
does not replace the component, relationship, or Token that conveys
architecture meaning. This lets a model keep describing `orders-api` while its
runtime deployment changes.

## Start here

- Read the normative [specification](./SPEC.md).
- Inspect the machine-readable [JSON Schemas](./schema/).
- Browse the valid [examples](./examples/).
- Read the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before proposing a change.

## Design principles

- **Semantic first:** define architectural intent before implementation.
- **Tool independent:** the same token can be referenced by diagrams, documents, linters, and automation.
- **Small and composable:** tokens should be reusable building blocks, not complete architecture models.
- **Human and machine readable:** definitions should be understandable in review and verifiable by software.
- **Incremental:** the core model should grow from demonstrated use cases.
